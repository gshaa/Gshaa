### About me

Since childhood, I liked computers and informatics.  I tried a lot of different directions and got interested in development a year ago.  So far, I've taken 2 HTML courses, 2 CSS courses, read the full JavaScript tutorial, learned es6, and solved a bunch of practical problems.  I made a website for my friend using PHP.  In addition, I have mastered many more skills, such as: git, github, webpack, figma.  I continue my education and learn React, Redux.  My goal is to find a job in the frontend industry and constantly improve my skills.
